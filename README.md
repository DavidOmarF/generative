# Generative art

Hi! This repository contains the pieces I've created to explore generative art.
For the moment, I'm migrating all my sketches into a [Ginpar][ginpar] version
of them, which makes them interactive and easy to play with.

To generate your own images using my code in an interactive way, check [gen.davidomar.com][web].

---

The `drafts/` directory contains all my original works that haven't been
adapted.

The `sketches/` directory contains the final versions of my works, and they are
easier to explore, understand, and modify.

If you want to modify any of the projects inside this repository and turn it
into a whole different project, you're not only allowed, but encouraged!

I'll be glad to know about your remixes, so hmu in twitter: [@davidomarf][twitter].
